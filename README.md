# Action Game Coding Project
This is a game inspired from traditional old games like Mario. This was done using python and Pygame. 

Ensure that you have installed all necessary libraries under 'requirements.txt'. 

Simply run action_game.py to play the game. 

There are also some preview videos showing what the game looks like. Enjoy them!

This was done in collaboration with ___ from National University of Singapore.
